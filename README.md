 # BusStopAlert
 Android App (in-development) that alerts the user with a notification, when its bus stop is approaching.
+
+# Why have this App.
+Did it ever happen to you that you were taking the bus somewhere and missed your stop? Well this app will alert you right before you reach your designated stop through a notification. Hence, you do not need to worry for missing your stop now!
+
+# How to use
+The app is still in-development, hence for testing purposes, anywhere you click on the map your gps location will change according to where you click. Other than that the app works alot like the original google maps. You search your destination address in the box above then press find. The map will zoom in to your destination and a small box at the bottom will appear. When you click that box, a list of possible routes to your destination will appear. When selecting a route, it will be drawn on the map with circles on certain locations. Those circles are there to show you when you will be notified, hence when approaching your bus stop when on bus. Details of your trip can be viewed when clicking the transit details box on the bottom.
